## The backend part of my exam project for the first semester of web-development


## After you have cloned the project, use this command to install all dependecies

```bash

```

## To run the backend use either of these to commands (start:dev listens for any changes you make in the code):

```bash

$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```

## To run the tests use this commands
